IF YOU ARE A COLLABORATOR READ THIS:

1. PLEASE ONLY COMMIT A CHANGE DIRECTLY TO THE MASTER BRANCH IF THE EDITS ARE FULLY FUNCTIONAL
   IF THEY AREN'T FULLY FUNCTIONAL/YOU CAN'T GET THE ISSUE WORKED OUT MAKE A NEW BRANCH, AND POST AN ISSUE IF NECECCARY 

2. IF YOU COMMIT SOMETHING ANYWHERE, PLEASE UPDATE IT WITH A NOTE, SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW WHAT YOU DID AND WHY YOU DID IT

Another game, but this time with tank controls
